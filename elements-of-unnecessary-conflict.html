    <h1>The Elements of Unnecessary Conflict</h1>
<p>Unnecessary conflict arises from six predictable communication patterns that create misunderstanding, trigger defensiveness, or obscure real issues.</p>
<h2>Assuming Shared Understanding</h2>
<p>Treating your meaning, perspective, or goal as universally obvious.<br />
→ <em>Creates hidden gaps; participants talk past each other and trade blame.</em></p>
<h2>Mind-Reading</h2>
<p>Claiming knowledge about someone's internal state (thoughts, feelings, motivations, intentions) without verification.<br />
→ <em>Shapes interaction through potentially false perception.</em></p>
<h2>Insufficient Justification</h2>
<p>Stating conclusions without supporting observations or logic.<br />
→ <em>Creates a duel of conclusions instead of shared examination.</em></p>
<h2>Imposing Perspective as Truth</h2>
<p>Treating your subjective view, values, or experience as objective reality that others should accept.<br />
→ <em>Forces others to fight for their own perspective to be acknowledged as valid.</em></p>
<h2>Implying Deficiencies</h2>
<p>Suggesting the other person is stupid, incompetent, or unethical.<br />
→ <em>Shifts focus from problem-solving to self-defense.</em></p>
<h2>Unnecessarily Pointing Out Error</h2>
<p>Leading with &quot;You're wrong&quot; or blunt correction.<br />
→ <em>Triggers face-saving behaviors over truth-seeking.</em></p>
