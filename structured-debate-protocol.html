    <h1>A Structured Debate Protocol</h1>
    <p>This protocol is designed to help participants in a debate or dialogue surface and clarify the underlying layers of disagreement when evaluating a phenomenon, claim, or concept. It addresses common pitfalls where factual, normative, evidentiary, and criterial assumptions are conflated.</p>

    <h2>1. Define the Claim</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the specific claim we are evaluating?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each participant articulates the claim in clear, unambiguous language. If there are multiple interpretations, they are listed explicitly.</p>
<h2>2. Clarify Values and Concerns</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What values, priorities, or concerns make this claim significant to you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each participant explains what stakes they see in the claim: practical utility, conceptual precision, moral implications, etc.</p>
<h2>3. Agree on Standards of Evidence</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What kind of evidence would you consider sufficient to support or refute the claim?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants articulate their evidentiary expectations explicitly: behavioral equivalence, internal states, experimental data, etc.</p>
<h2>4. Specify Criteria</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What specific abilities or properties must be demonstrated to count as meeting the claim?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Participants enumerate clear, operational benchmarks or conditions that define success.</p>
<h2>Notes on Facilitation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid conflating descriptive (factual) claims with normative (value) judgments.</li>
<li>Explicitly surface and acknowledge differing priorities: practical vs. conceptual, etc.</li>
<li>Use curiosity rather than confrontation to explore why others hold different standards or criteria.</li>
<li>Document agreed definitions and points of divergence for future reference.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Transform apparent factual disputes into clear, structured discussions that considerately acknowledge underlying conceptual and normative differences, reducing talking past each other.</p>
