    <h1>Speaking in Specifics</h1>
    <p>A practical guide for preventing unnecessary conflict by moving from vague, abstract judgments to clear, specific expression.</p>
  </header>
  <article>
    <p>This guide provides a method for descending the &quot;<a href="#" title="Hayakawa, S. I. (1949). Language in Thought and Action">abstraction ladder</a>&quot; to prevent misunderstandings before they become conflicts. The core practice is to express our actual needs, desires, and observations clearly, rather than packaging them in vague, universal judgments.</p>
<h3>1. How high are you... on the abstraction ladder?</h3>
<p>Most unnecessary conflicts arise from speaking at a high level of abstraction, which creates ambiguity. Ground-level expression, rooted in specific experience, fosters understanding even amid disagreement.</p>
<p><strong>Top Level (Abstract):</strong> &quot;That's absurd. They don't understand anything.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Ground Level (Specific):</strong> &quot;When they claimed X, it contradicted my direct experience with Y, which leads me to believe their model is incomplete.&quot;</p>
<p>Questions to determine if it's a high level abstraction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Could this label point to many different things?</li>
<li>How vague or ambiguous is this?</li>
<li>How much is this concept influenced by subjective interpretation?</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Is it your experience or universal truth?</h3>
<p>We naturally generalize from our experiences, but presenting these generalizations as objective facts creates immediate conflict by invalidating the different experiences of others. The key is to own our experience <em>as our experience</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Universal Claim:</strong> &quot;Doctors don't listen.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Specific Experience:</strong> &quot;During my last appointment, my doctor interrupted me and didn't address my primary concern.&quot;</p>
<p>Reality check:</p>
<ul>
<li>What evidence would falsify this claim?</li>
<li>How many cases did your study analyze?</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. What's motivating you?</h3>
<p>Behind every abstract complaint is a specific, motivating driver: a need, desire, preference, standard, belief, or priority. Identifying this driver allows us to express ourselves more clearly and transform a vague attack into a concrete, discussable issue.</p>
<p><strong>Abstract Attack:</strong> &quot;I can't live with a slob.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Specific Motivation:</strong> &quot;My standard for cleaning isn't being met, and that's creating significant stress for me.&quot;</p>
<h3>4. How can your language create possibility?</h3>
<p>Prescriptive or absolute language (&quot;You must,&quot; &quot;The fact is...&quot;) triggers psychological reactance, causing others to resist instinctively. Tentative language defuses this by creating space for others to consider a perspective without feeling cornered.</p>
<p><strong>Certainty (Closes Possibility):</strong> &quot;This proves my point.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Tentative (Opens Possibility):</strong> &quot;My experience suggests this might be the case.&quot;</p>
<h3>5. How can curiosity build bridges?</h3>
<p>When faced with an abstract claim, the instinct is to counter with another abstraction, creating a &quot;war of abstractions.&quot; A more productive approach is to use curiosity to guide the conversation down the ladder to specifics.</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;What specific impacts of that policy concern you the most?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Can you give me an example of when this caused a problem?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What would need to be different for this to work for you?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Curiosity builds bridges, where certainty builds walls.</p>
