    <h1>Fundamental Questions of Epistemology</h1>
<p>The most fundamental epistemic questions are those that examine the foundations, limits, and validity of knowledge itself. Here is a structured list of these core questions:</p>
<h2>1. Nature of Knowledge</h2>
<ul>
<li>What is knowledge?</li>
<li>What distinguishes knowledge from belief or opinion?</li>
<li>What is required for something to count as knowledge? (Justification, truth, belief?)</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Source and Reliability</h2>
<ul>
<li>How do we acquire knowledge?</li>
<li>What makes a source of knowledge reliable or unreliable?</li>
<li>Is there an ultimate authority or foundation for justified belief?</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. Limits of Knowledge</h2>
<ul>
<li>What can we truly know for certain?</li>
<li>Are there inherent limits to human knowledge? If so, what defines them?</li>
<li>Can we ever fully know an external reality beyond our perceptions?</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. Truth and Justification</h2>
<ul>
<li>What does it mean for a belief to be justified?</li>
<li>What criteria must a claim meet to be considered true?</li>
<li>Can justification ever be absolute or is it always provisional?</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Skepticism and Certainty</h2>
<ul>
<li>How do you respond to radical skepticism about knowledge claims?</li>
<li>Is absolute certainty achievable, or is all knowledge inherently uncertain?</li>
<li>What practical role does doubt or uncertainty serve in the pursuit of knowledge?</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Subjectivity and Objectivity</h2>
<ul>
<li>To what extent is knowledge subjective or objective?</li>
<li>Can personal subjective experiences ever provide reliable knowledge?</li>
<li>How can we reconcile multiple coherent subjective realities?</li>
</ul>
<h2>7. Knowledge and Action</h2>
<ul>
<li>How does what we claim to know influence our actions?</li>
<li>How does practical experience validate or invalidate theoretical knowledge?</li>
<li>In what ways does embodiment or lived experience determine epistemic validity?</li>
</ul>
<h2>8. Change and Revision</h2>
<ul>
<li>How can knowledge change in response to new evidence or experiences?</li>
<li>At what point do you abandon or revise a belief?</li>
<li>How does knowledge evolve or adapt over time?</li>
</ul>
<h2>9. Social and Cultural Factors</h2>
<ul>
<li>How do social, cultural, and historical contexts shape knowledge?</li>
<li>Are there universally valid epistemic standards, or are standards context-dependent?</li>
<li>How does power or authority affect what is accepted as knowledge?</li>
</ul>
<p>These foundational questions collectively form a framework for rigorous epistemic inquiry and serve as a reference for navigating complex, contested, or uncertain domains.</p>
