    <h1>Introspective Questions Can Prevent Conflict</h1>
<p>You can prevent conflict from even having a foundation by asking yourself the following questions.</p>
<h2>Reflective Questions to Prevent Unnecessary Conflict</h2>
<p><strong>On motivation and purpose:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What am I hoping to accomplish by saying or doing this?</li>
<li>Is my goal to connect, to prove something, to defend myself, or to punish?</li>
<li>How likely is it that my goal will be achieved in the way I intend?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On emotional state:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>What feelings am I noticing right now?</li>
<li>Am I acting out of defensiveness, anger, fear, or curiosity?</li>
<li>Do I feel an urge to “win” or to “understand”?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On assumptions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Am I assuming we both mean the same thing by this term?</li>
<li>What am I assuming about their intentions—do I have evidence?</li>
<li>Could there be another explanation for their behavior?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On clarity:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have I clearly stated what matters to me?</li>
<li>Do I know what matters to them? Have I asked?</li>
<li>Am I speaking from specific observations or vague generalizations?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On framing:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Is what I’m about to say likely to threaten their sense of identity, autonomy, or status?</li>
<li>Could I reframe my words to focus on the issue rather than the person?</li>
<li>Am I using loaded language or making unfavorable comparisons?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>On epistemic humility:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How certain am I that my perspective is correct?</li>
<li>What’s the strongest argument against my position?</li>
<li>Could their position also seem coherent from their perspective?</li>
</ul>
