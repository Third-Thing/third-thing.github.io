    <h1>Positive Prevention of Unnecessary Conflict</h1>
<p>Positive action you can take to prevent unnecessary conflict.</p>
<h2>Evaluate, Prepare and Express</h2>
<p>The evaluation can help if you want to avoid wasting energy on a lost cause. No amount of considerateness, care or reasoning can overcome the desire to maintain a belief. And no one performing for an audience wants to be corrected or educated.</p>
<h3>0. <strong>Evaluate</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Does the other person seem to have a desire to maintain their belief?</li>
<li>Do they seem interested in learning, or displaying their righteousness or intelligence?</li>
</ul>
<h3>1. <strong>Prepare</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>What's important to you? What are your priorities?</li>
<li>Get clear on your intention and goal.</li>
<li>Consider assumptions, ambiguity and counter-arguments.</li>
<li>Consider reasons for/against and evidence/counter-evidence.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. <strong>Express</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Use specific terms or clarify meanings.</li>
<li>Note the experiences and evidence that shaped your stance.</li>
<li>Frame claims as subjective and provisional.</li>
<li>State intentions explicitly.</li>
<li>Ask questions rather than point out errors.</li>
<li>Help the other person save face.</li>
<li>Let small lapses in courtesy slide when possible.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2><strong>S.I.G.N.A.L.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>S</strong>tate your <strong>Specifics</strong> (replace vague language; share observations).</li>
<li><strong>I</strong>ntentions declared (yours) and <strong>inquired</strong> (theirs).</li>
<li><strong>G</strong>round your stance in lived <strong>Gut-level experiences</strong> and supporting evidence.</li>
<li><strong>N</strong>eeds / priorities named.</li>
<li><strong>A</strong>sk, don’t accuse (questions over error-pointing; ignore petty slights).</li>
<li><strong>L</strong>ink back to the <strong>Larger goal</strong> to stay on track.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3>Honesty</h3>
<p><em>(Be open about what is driving your view.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the experiences that shaped your perspective.</li>
<li>Describe the observations or data you treat as evidence.</li>
<li>Frame your claims as provisional: “From my angle this seems true, but I could be missing something.”</li>
<li>State your intentions and invite theirs: “Here’s what I’m hoping to achieve—how about you?”</li>
<li>Name your underlying needs, preferences, standards, or priorities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lucidness</h3>
<p><em>(Make the conversation easy to follow.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Replace vague or ambiguous terms with concrete wording, or briefly explain what you mean.</li>
<li>Keep sight of the shared goal: remind yourself and the other person why the discussion matters.</li>
<li>Ask clarifying questions instead of declaring errors when something sounds off; it surfaces misunderstandings without derailing flow.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Considerateness</h3>
<p><em>(Protect the other person’s dignity and the relationship.)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Help them maintain face: critique ideas or behaviors, not character.</li>
<li>Ignore minor lapses in politeness that you can safely ignore.</li>
<li>Use questions (e.g., “Could you walk me through that?”) rather than blunt corrections when the context allows.</li>
</ul>
