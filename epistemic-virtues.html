<h2><strong>Sample “Epistemic Virtue Audit”</strong></h2>
<ul>

<li>☐ Did we <strong>consider alternative viewpoints</strong> fairly?</li>
<li>☐ Did we <strong>note and question our own biases</strong>?</li>
<li>☐ Did we <strong>admit knowledge gaps</strong> instead of bluffing?</li>
<li>☐ Did we <strong>maintain a consistent standard of evidence</strong> throughout?</li>
</ul>
